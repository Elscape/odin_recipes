<h2>Shopska salad - The most famous Bulgarian salad!</h2>
<p>Phenomenal Shopska salad is a cucumber, tomato, and onion salad (plus peppers and cheese) you'll love! </p>
<p>Flavorful and uncomplicated, even the European Parliament voted Shopska the best European dish!</p> 

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Tomatoes: Roma, tomatoes on the vine (Campari), and plum tomatoes work best. Sub with beefsteak or Brandywine tomatoes.</li>
    <li>Peppers: Local babura peppers (green/ yellow) and devil's horn peppers (red) are best. Sub with banana peppers, or yellow and red bell peppers. Avoid: green bell peppers as they're sour.</li>
    <li>Onion: Yellow onion is the go-to for this recipe. Sub with sweet and white onions. Avoid: red, shallots, and green onions. (Use if you must, but the salad will taste differently.)</li>
    <li>Cheese: Mild to sharp, white, cow and goat, semi-hard, and hard cheeses (preferably brined) are great options. Feta too. If using Greek feta find a type with less salt. (Care for a recommendation? Find a mild, semi-hard white cheese.) Smoked cheeses work wonderfully as well. Crumble or grate them. Finally, soft cheeses work well too, although they melt quickly when grated.</li>
    <li>Vinaigrette: This is purely a matter of preference! Some like this salad just as is. Others add a vinaigrette or a splash of oil. I like it best when I make my own. If you decide to make a vinaigrette, make it a basic one. Vinaigrette isn't and shouldn't be the spotlight of Shopska salad.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Dice all salad ingredients and layer them in a salad bowl.</li>
    <li>If making a vinaigrette, combine ingredients and whisk. Pour over salad. Mix well. If not making a vinaigrette, add salt and pepper and mix.</li>
    <li>Top with grated cheese.</li>
</ol>
